# BlockEmpires stats website  
  
This site was written using SpringBoot, NodeJS, and React  
to display stats for players on the   
blockempires server.  
  
Currently the server is not up, so the data being used  
is mock data to help with debugging.  
  
This is a living project and will be updated with   
more features.  
  
A live version can be found on my website
